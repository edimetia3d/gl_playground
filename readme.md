# OPENGL PLUS PLUS

## Introduction

In OpenGL developing, you need to init the opengl context, loading the function pointers, and create window to show
the result, all by yourself. There are many great libraries though, but they often do not provide a complete solution,
that is, you still need to do a lot of things to prepare your working environment before drawing your first triangle.

GLPP is an all-in-one playground for learning OpenGL. It provides a [learningopengl](https://learnopengl.com/) style
off-the-shelf solution for you to start your OpenGL journey, which may help you to focus on the OpenGL itself when you
are learning it.

1. Pre-configured GLFW/GLM/GLAD libraries.
2. Basic wrapper of GLFW and OpenGL, to make them more C++ style.
